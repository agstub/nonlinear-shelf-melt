viscoelastic-glines

This is essentially a fork of agstub/grounding-line-methods with the subglacial
lake model removed and a large-deformation (upper-convected_) Maxwell model for viscoelasticity
implemented for the marine ice sheet problem (Glen's law viscosity).

See notes.ipynb for a short description of the problem, and the weak forms in the finite
element implementation.
