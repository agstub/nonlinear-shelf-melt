viscoelastic-glines

This is essentially a fork of agstub/grounding-line-methods with the subglacial
lake model removed and a small deformation Maxwell model for viscoelasticity
implemented for the marine ice sheet problem (Newtonian viscosity).

See notes.ipynb for the relevant modifications to the model.
