nonlinear-shelf-melt

This is nonlinear Stokes model for ice-shelf flow driven by melting or freezing at the (sub-shelf) ice-water interface.

The finite element method is implemented in FEniCSx (https://fenicsproject.org).

The code can be run from the source directory (run main.py), e.g., via a Docker container
